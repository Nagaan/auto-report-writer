Design a standardised report template that captures essential information:

    Vulnerability Details
        Classification
            Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational
        Vulnerability Name
            CVSS Score
            CVSS Vector
            Vulnerability Description
            Recommendations
            Vulnerable Instances

Define a structured format for presenting the report:

    Project Summary - Header (Manually Input)
        Details - Paragraph (Manually Input)
        Description - Paragraph (Manually Input)

    Vulnerability Details - Header (Imported)
        Classification - Sub-Header (Calculated)
            Critical/High/Medium/Low/Informational - Based on CVSS Score
        Vulnerability Name - Sub-Header (Imported)
            CVSS Score - Floating Point Number (Imported)
            CVSS Vector - String (Imported)
            Vulnerability Description - Paragraph (Imported/Generated*)
            Recommendations - Paragraph (Imported/Generated*)
            Vulnerable Instances - String (Imported)
    ...

    * In the event of missing recommendations, use generalised recommendations.
      The following should be missing recommendations:
        Metasploit:
            General Advice: Regularly update systems, apply patches, and follow best practices for security configurations.
            Consult Resources: Look up specific exploits on databases like CVE or security forums for advice on mitigation.
            Vendor Documentation: Review vendor advisories for guidance on addressing specific vulnerabilities.
        PlcScan:
            General Advice: Ensure PLCs are configured securely, use strong passwords, and limit network access.
            Consult Resources: Refer to guidelines for securing industrial control systems.
            Vendor Documentation: Check PLC manufacturersâ€™ security recommendations.
        Scapy:
            General Advice: Encrypt sensitive data and use secure protocols.
            Consult Resources: Look up best practices for network traffic security.
            Vendor Documentation: Review documentation for protocols in use.
        Smod-1:
            General Advice: Implement proper authentication and authorization controls for Modbus communications.
            Consult Resources: Check Modbus security guidelines and best practices.
            Vendor Documentation: Consult documentation from Modbus device vendors.
        TcpDump:
            General Advice: Encrypt traffic and secure network communications.
            Consult Resources: Look up practices for protecting data in transit.
            Vendor Documentation: Review network security recommendations for the tools in use.

Develop a mechanism for automatically populating the template with relevant
information obtained from automated tests.

    OT System Penetration Tests output results as XML files.
    Write a script that takes multiple inputs (the various output results).
        Use Python - Predecessor project used Python.
    Write a script that populates the various fields of the report with data from the inputs.
    Finally, output the result.
        XSL + XML -> HTML
            Use xsltproc (Linux) to apply the XSL to the XML, creating the HTML.
                xsltproc fileName.xsl fileName.xml > output.html
