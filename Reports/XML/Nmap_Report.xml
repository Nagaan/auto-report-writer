Implement stored procedures, which encapsulate SQL logic within the database to minimize exposure to injection. Validate and sanitize all user inputs to adhere to expected formats, thereby rejecting potentially harmful data. Utilize ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) libraries to abstract SQL operations, reducing direct interaction with raw SQL. Restrict database user privileges to the minimum necessary for application functionality. Properly handle errors by avoiding the exposure of detailed SQL error messages to users; instead, log them securely. Regularly conduct security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities, and consider using web application firewalls (WAFs) to filter out malicious SQL attempts.
